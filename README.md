## How bcrypt is implemented for password hashing:

Hash passwords securely by using **bcrypt** algorithm. The hashing is done in the service layer, and the password is never stored in plaintext. Here's how bcrypt is implemented:

1. **Password Hashing**: The password is hashed using `BCryptPasswordEncoder` before storing it in the database.
2. **Password Verification**: During login, the hashed password is verified by comparing the entered password with the stored hash using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.
